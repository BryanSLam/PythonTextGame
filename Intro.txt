You are inside a tower with 7 floors, each floor containing numerous monsters, hidden treasures, 

and a floor boss at each level.  Only by defeating each floor boss will you be allowed to move onto

the next floor.  The rooms are all open space in a 4x4 grid where each turn you'll be asked which direction

you'd like to move to.  Each floor space can either contain a treasure chest, a shop, or a monster.  The floor

boss will only appear after clearing every monster on the floor on the top left corner of the grid and a 

notification will let you know when the boss appears.
